	<h1>From love for lavender</h1>
	<p><span>Lavender</span> (botanic name Lavandula) is a genus of 39 species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the Old World and is found from Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, southern Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to southeast India.</p> 
	<p>Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils.

	<p><span>Lavender oil</span> is an essential oil obtained by distillation from the flower spikes of certain species of lavender.</p>
	<p>Lavender oil, which has long been used in the production of perfume, can also be used in aromatherapy. The scent has a calming effect which may aid in relaxation and the reduction of anxiety and stress.
	It may also help to relieve pain from tension headache when breathed in as vapor or diluted and rubbed on the skin. When added to a vaporizer, lavender oil may aid in the treatment of cough and respiratory infection.</p>

	<p><span>Culinary use</span> Flowers yield abundant nectar from which bees make a high-quality honey. Monofloral honey is produced primarily around the Mediterranean, and is marketed worldwide as a premium product. Flowers can be candied and are sometimes used as cake decorations. Lavender flavors baked goods and desserts (it pairs especially well with chocolate), and is also used to make "lavender sugar". Lavender flowers are occasionally blended with black, green, or herbal tea, adding a fresh, relaxing scent and flavor.</p>

	<p><span>Dried lavender</span> has plenty of uses, such as potpourris, lavender bags, moth repellants, relaxation and more.</p>
	<p>If you would like to dry lavender bunches yourself, make sure to 
	 cut nice long stems. Gather together small bunches and secure them  together with a rubber band. 
Hang your bunches upside-down to dry in a dark, well ventilated place. Your dried lavender should be ready in about a month.</p><p> Photo : <a href="http://everything-lavender.com">everything-lavender.com</a></p>
